\section{Existing validation}


Validation of neutronics codes in a fission environment is generally well established procedure, this is partly due to the large quantity of experimental results such as ICSBEP \cite{iscbep} and open access benchmarks.

Criticality experiments calculations provide a particularly precise measurement for comparing codes with experiments as the value is known to a high degree of accuracy and codes can be compared on their prediction of reactivity measured to accuracies of one-thousandth of a percent (pcm).

Validation of neutronics codes in a fusion and accelerator environments is less established as fusion neutrons are generally less available and sources are not characterised to the same degree of accuracy.

Although neutron transport in fission and fusion share many fundamental similarities, the higher energy range of particles results in a larger variety of reactions and therefore merits independent validation.

This is particularly true for DT fusion where the neutron energy is sufficient for additional nuclear reactions that have an energy threshold.  

OpenMC \cite{OpenMC} has been designed with validation in mind with the provision of modern software practices that are not always present in legacy codes. As OpenMC is an open source much of the tests are publicaly available. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item continuous integration \cite{OpenMC_CI}
  \item unit tests \cite{OpenMC_UT} 
  \item regression tests \cite{OpenMC_regT}
  \item analytical benchmarks \cite{openmc_keff_analytical_benchmarks}
  \item validation suite (including ICSBEP and 7 other benchmark series) \cite{OpenMC_benchmark_suite}
\end{itemize}


User driven validation several fission reactor benchmarks have been carried out for specific designs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{openmc_vera_core_benchmarks}, 
    \item \cite{openmc_burnup_benchmark}
    \item \cite{openmc_beavrs_benchmark}
    \item \cite{openmc_beavrs2_benchmark}
    \item \cite{openmc_beavrs3_benchmark}
    \item \cite{openmc_lwr_benchmark}.
\end{itemize}

There remains a need to add fusion relevant benchmarks (shielding benchmarks with 14MeV neutrons) to the open validation suite which will help further establish OpenMC as a reliable neutronics code.

The benefit of openly accessible validation goes beyond ease of access and the benchmarks are reproducible when possible.

Where the models are open it is entirely (e.g. \cite{Conderc}) possible to reproduce the entire simulations, however in the case of SINBAD and ICSBEP which are NEA licensed then this is not possible.
Share the input and post processing aspects of the benchmark without the specific geometry is the standard approach.
People wishing to reproduce the simulations will have to acquire the geometry and usage license from the NEA to reproduce these proritory benchmarks.


\section{Ongoing validation efforts}



Benchmarking of neutronics codes for shielding is a vital step in validating neutronics codes. The Sinbad suite \cite{Sinbad_benchmark_suite} of shielding benchmarks is available in two formats. The majority of models are available in MCNP constructive solid geometry (CSG) geometry format while some models are just available in diagram form.





This existing distribution suits just one individual code (MCNP). Validating additional codes therefore comes with the overhead of translating the geometry into geometry native to the neutronics code. 



The development of CSG2CSG \cite{CSG2CSG} eases the translation of MCNP formatted CSG geometry into other CSG formats. For example using CSG2CSG one can translate MCNP into OpenMC. OpenMC supports CSG geometry but also supports faceted geometry that can easily be created from CAD geometry. 

mention the oak ridge code that simulates multiple models and pyarc from argonne and Oxford sigmas beast


Currently 6 of Sinbad benchmarks have been converted and simulated using the CSG2CSG approach and produce good agreement between MCNP and OpenMC.


The development of MCNP2CAD \cite{mcnp2cad} can convert MCNP CSG geometry into CAD geometry. CAD geometry can then be faceted and used in neutronics simulations using DAGMC \cite{dagmc}. The benefit of using faceted geometry is that the model could then be run in any DAGMC compatible code (OpenMC, Fluka, MCNP, Tripoli4, Geant4). 


Converting the models in Sinbad that exist only in diagram form into useful formats for neutronics could be performed via two different routes. One could write up the geometry in MCNP format then convert it into other formats using MCNP2CAD and CSG2CSG. Alternatively one could use Opencascade (python or C++) or FreeCAD (python), CAD Query (python) to script the creation of CAD geometry. Both programs allow the creation of CAD geometry from numbers which can be found on the diagrams. Another option is OpenSCAD which could be considered and provides a more CSG friendly input. It is preferential that the creation is performed via script in an opensource CAD tool so that potential users all have the ability to recreate the CAD if they want to tweak parts.


With the recent creation of the DLopen addition \cite{dlopen} to OpenMC we now have the ability to model complex compiled sources such as a plasma sources and the Frascati neutron generator (FNG). 

An opensource OpenMC training course \cite{openmc_workshop} has now been used to train approximately 40 students and this resource would also be used to facilitate the aquistion of OpenMC skills needed for the project.

Ideally the Sinbad suite would exist in both CSG format for every neutronics code and also in CAD format. One could then easily compare results between codes and geometry types.

In the longer term with initiatives like the European Open Data we could see shielding benchmarks more freely distributed. This would allow them to be included in regression testing and continuous integration. An opensource release of multi code, multi geometry Sinbad benchmark suite is something that could increase the impact any effort spent creating the suite. While the target is to cover the full Sinbad suite we must priorities benchmarks based on ease of geometry, model creation and value.

Along with the prevalent 9-isotope vector methodology, a set of 16-isotopes, based on their relative importance, have been employed in the whole core calculations and the corresponding computed values of integral parameters been compared. Comparison of effective core multiplication factor is made with studies performed by various organizations, employing different codes based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo methodologies.

    abstractNote = {Advances in parallel computing have made possible the development of high-fidelity tools for the design and analysis of nuclear reactor cores, and such tools require extensive verification and validation. This paper introduces BEAVRS, a new multi-cycle full-core Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) depletion benchmark based on two operational cycles of a commercial nuclear power plant that provides a detailed description of fuel assemblies, burnable absorbers, in-core fission detectors, core loading patterns, and numerous in-vessel components. This benchmark enables analysts to develop extremely detailed reactor core models that can be used for testing and validation of coupled neutron transport, thermal-hydraulics, and fuel isotopic depletion. The benchmark also provides measured reactor data for Hot Zero Power (HZP) physics tests, boron letdown curves, and three-dimensional in-core flux maps from fifty-eight instrumented assemblies. Initial comparisons between calculations performed with MIT's OpenMC Monte Carlo neutron transport code and measured cycle 1 HZP test data are presented, and these results display an average deviation of approximately 100 pcm for the various critical configurations and control rod worth measurements. Computed HZP radial fission detector flux maps also agree reasonably well with the available measured data. All results indicate that this benchmark will be extremely useful in validation of coupled-physics codes and uncertainty quantification of in-core physics computational predictions. The detailed BEAVRS specification and its associated data package is hosted online at the MIT Computational Reactor Physics Group web site (http://crpg.mit.edu/), where future revisions and refinements to the benchmark specification will be made publicly available.
